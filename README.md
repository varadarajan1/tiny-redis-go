# TINY REDIS GO

This is a tiny implementation of redis I am building to learn about redis and also explore golang.

This project was bootrapped from Codecrafters' ["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis). 

To start the server, run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` from the root folder.
